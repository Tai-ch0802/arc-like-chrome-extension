## 🔥 Key Features

### 🔗 Exclusive Innovation: Linked Tabs
This is our most powerful feature! When you open a bookmark from the sidebar, we automatically create a **"Link"**.
- **Avoid Tab Clutter**: Click the link icon next to a bookmark to see all tabs opened from it, helping you avoid opening duplicates and saving system resources.
- **Two-Way Sync**: When a tab is closed, the bookmark status updates automatically; when a bookmark is deleted, the linked tab is handled intelligently.
- **Visual Feedback**: A refined link icon appears next to bookmarks, letting you know at a glance which ones are currently active.

### ⚡️ Smart Rendering
Have thousands of bookmarks? No problem!
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Switched from Virtual Scrolling to an efficient Dynamic Rendering mechanism, ensuring smooth performance with better compatibility.
- **Smooth Experience**: Navigate through large bookmark libraries effortlessly without lag.

### 🪟 Cross-Window Management
- **Window Overview**: View tabs from all open Chrome windows directly in the sidebar, not just the current one.
- **Global Search**: Search results include tabs from all windows, allowing for instant navigation across your entire session.
### 🔍 Professional Grade Search
Don't just search—find instantly.
- **Multi-Keyword Filtering**: Supports space-separated keywords (e.g., "google docs work") for precise targeting.
- **Domain Search**: Type a domain (like `github.com`) to instantly filter tabs and bookmarks from specific sources.

### 🗂️ Unified Workspace

- **Drag to Save**: Drag a tab into the bookmarks area to save it instantly; drag a bookmark to the tabs area to open it.
- **Reading List & RSS**: Your personal hub for article curation. Sync with the native Chrome Reading List, subscribe to RSS feeds, and manage everything in one place with smart deduplication and sorting.

### 🎨 Premium Design & Customization
