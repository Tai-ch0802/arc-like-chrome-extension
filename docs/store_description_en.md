Latest Version - 1.7.0
✨ New Features
- Bookmark-Tab Linking: Implemented an Arc-style feature to link bookmarks with tabs. Now, clicking a bookmark or dragging a tab to create a bookmark automatically creates a link. A link icon appears next to the bookmark, which can be clicked to view all linked tabs for quick switching or closing.
- New Christmas Theme: Added a soft and warm Christmas theme in the settings to celebrate the holiday season.

🚀 Improvements & Bug Fixes
- Drag-to-Bookmark Guard: When dragging a tab to create a bookmark, the system now checks if a bookmark with the same URL already exists and shows a confirmation dialog to prevent duplicates.
