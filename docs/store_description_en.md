## 🔥 Key Features

### 🔗 Exclusive Innovation: Linked Tabs
This is our most powerful feature! When you open a bookmark from the sidebar, we automatically create a **"Link"**.
- **Avoid Tab Clutter**: Click the link icon next to a bookmark to see all tabs opened from it, helping you avoid opening duplicates and saving system resources.
- **Two-Way Sync**: When a tab is closed, the bookmark status updates automatically; when a bookmark is deleted, the linked tab is handled intelligently.
- **Visual Feedback**: A refined link icon appears next to bookmarks, letting you know at a glance which ones are currently active.

### ⚡️ Blazing Performance: Virtual Scrolling
Have thousands of bookmarks? No problem!
- **Zero Latency**: Even with **10,000+** bookmarks, the sidebar remains silky smooth.
- **Memory Optimized**: Powered by an advanced virtualization engine that only renders visible items, significantly reducing memory usage.

### 🔍 Professional Grade Search
Don't just search—find instantly.
- **Multi-Keyword Filtering**: Supports space-separated keywords (e.g., "google docs work") for precise targeting.
- **Domain Search**: Type a domain (like `github.com`) to instantly filter tabs and bookmarks from specific sources.
- **Smart Highlighting**: Real-time highlighting of matched keywords keeps your visual focus clear.

### 🗂️ Unified Workspace
- **Vertical Tabs**: View full page titles, no longer compressed into tiny icons.
- **Native Group Support**: Perfectly integrates with Chrome Tab Groups, syncing colors and names.
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive management—move items effortlessly between tabs, groups, and bookmark folders.
- **Drag to Save**: Drag a tab into the bookmarks area to save it instantly; drag a bookmark to the tabs area to open it.

### 🎨 Premium Design
- **Focus Mode**: A sleek dark theme with carefully tuned contrast to reduce eye strain.
