# Color Theory & Grading

## Color Spaces

-   **sRGB**: Standard Red Green Blue. The default for the web and most consumer displays. Safe choice.
-   **Adobe RGB**: Wider gamut than sRGB. Used in professional photography and print.
-   **Display P3**: Wide color gamut used by Apple devices and modern high-end displays. Brighter reds and greens.
-   **CMYK**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black). **Subtractive** color model used for **printing**. Do NOT use for web/screens.
-   **HSL / HSV**: Hue, Saturation, Lightness/Value. More intuitive for humans to pick colors than RGB codes.

## Color Grading

Adjusting colors for aesthetic effect.

-   **Color Correction**: Fixing technical issues (white balance, exposure) to make the image look "natural".
-   **Color Grading**: Creative styling (e.g., "Cinematic" teal and orange look).
-   **Temperature**: Warm (Orange/Yellow) vs Cool (Blue).
-   **Tint**: Green vs Magenta correction.
-   **Saturation**: Intensity of colors.
-   **Vibrance**: Smart saturation—boosts muted colors more than already saturated ones, protecting skin tones.

## Color Harmonies

-   **Complementary**: Opposite on the color wheel (e.g., Blue & Orange). High contrast, dynamic.
-   **Analogous**: Next to each other (e.g., Red, Orange, Yellow). Harmonious, calming.
-   **Triadic**: Three colors evenly spaced (e.g., Red, Blue, Yellow). Balanced but vibrant.
-   **Monochromatic**: Variations in lightness and saturation of a single hue. Clean, minimal.

## Accessibility (WCAG)

-   **Contrast Ratio**: Essential for text readability on colored backgrounds.
    -   **AA Standard**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text.
    -   **AAA Standard**: Minimum 7:1 for normal text.
-   **Color Blindness**: Avoid relying *only* on color to convey information (e.g., distinct shapes for status icons, not just Red vs Green).
