## ‚ö° Features

* **Unified Management Interface**: Manage all your **tabs** and **bookmarks** in a single, clean sidebar.
* **Powerful Interactions**:
    * **Drag & Drop Sorting**: Freely reorder tabs, tab groups, bookmarks, and bookmark folders just the way you like.
    * **Cross-Zone Dragging**: Quickly create a new bookmark by simply dragging a tab into any bookmark folder.
    * **Hover-to-Open**: While dragging, hover over a collapsed folder for a second, and it will automatically expand, allowing you to drop items into deeply nested structures with ease.
    * **Quick Actions**: Use hover-activated buttons to quickly close a tab, delete a bookmark, or create a new folder inside another.
* **Smart State Persistence**: The expanded/collapsed state of your bookmark folders is remembered. Even after the list refreshes from an action like creating or deleting a bookmark, your view state is perfectly restored.
* **Native Feature Integration**:
    * **Tab Groups**: Flawlessly renders native Chrome Tab Groups, including their titles and colors, in a collapsible interface.
    * **Favicons**: Automatically fetches and displays favicons for both tabs and bookmarks for easy identification.
* **Instant Search & Filter**: Instantly filter through all visible tabs and bookmarks by simply typing a keyword.
* **Custom Geek Theme**: Features a high-contrast dark theme with a hacker-green accent, designed for both style and readability.
* **Keyboard Shortcut**: Toggle the sidebar with `Command+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows).

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Commands

This project uses a `Makefile` to automate the build process.

*   **Development Mode**: `make` or `make package`

    This command creates an unminified development build. All source code remains as-is, making it easy to debug in Chrome's developer tools. The packaged file will be `arc-sidebar-v<version>-dev.zip`.

*   **Production Mode**: `make release`

    This command runs the production build process, which includes the following steps:
    1.  Bundles and minifies all JavaScript modules into a single file using `esbuild`.
    2.  Minifies the CSS file.
    3.  Packages the output into a `.zip` file suitable for uploading to the Chrome Web Store.
