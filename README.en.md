## âš¡ Features

* **Unified Management Interface**: Manage all your **tabs** and **bookmarks** in a single, clean sidebar.
* **Powerful Interactions**:
    * **Drag & Drop Sorting**: Freely reorder tabs, tab groups, bookmarks, and bookmark folders just the way you like.
    * **Cross-Zone Dragging**: Quickly create a new bookmark by simply dragging a tab into any bookmark folder.
    * **Hover-to-Open**: While dragging, hover over a collapsed folder for a second, and it will automatically expand, allowing you to drop items into deeply nested structures with ease.
    * **Quick Actions**: Use hover-activated buttons to quickly close a tab, delete a bookmark, or create a new folder inside another.
* **Smart State Persistence**: The expanded/collapsed state of your bookmark folders is remembered. Even after the list refreshes from an action like creating or deleting a bookmark, your view state is perfectly restored.
* **Native Feature Integration**:
    * **Tab Groups**: Flawlessly renders native Chrome Tab Groups, including their titles and colors, in a collapsible interface.
    * **Favicons**: Automatically fetches and displays favicons for both tabs and bookmarks for easy identification.
* **Instant Search & Filter**: Instantly filter through all visible tabs and bookmarks by simply typing a keyword.
* **Custom Geek Theme**: Features a high-contrast dark theme with a hacker-green accent, designed for both style and readability.
* **Keyboard Shortcut**: Toggle the sidebar with `Command+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows).
