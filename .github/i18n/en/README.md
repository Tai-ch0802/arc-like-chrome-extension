## 🔥 Key Features

### 🔗 Exclusive Innovation: Linked Tabs
This is our most powerful feature! When you open a bookmark from the sidebar, we automatically create a **"Link"**.
- **Avoid Tab Clutter**: Click the link icon next to a bookmark to see all tabs opened from it, helping you avoid opening duplicates and saving system resources.
- **Two-Way Sync**: When a tab is closed, the bookmark status updates automatically; when a bookmark is deleted, the linked tab is handled intelligently.
- **Visual Feedback**: A refined link icon appears next to bookmarks, letting you know at a glance which ones are currently active.

### ⚡️ Smart Rendering
Have thousands of bookmarks? No problem!
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Switched from Virtual Scrolling to an efficient Dynamic Rendering mechanism, ensuring smooth performance with better compatibility.
- **Smooth Experience**: Navigate through large bookmark libraries effortlessly without lag.

### 🪟 Cross-Window Management
- **Window Overview**: View tabs from all open Chrome windows directly in the sidebar, not just the current one.
- **Global Search**: Search results include tabs from all windows, allowing for instant navigation across your entire session.

### 🔍 Professional Grade Search
Don't just search—find instantly.
- **Multi-Keyword Filtering**: Supports space-separated keywords (e.g., "google docs work") for precise targeting.
- **Domain Search**: Type a domain (like `github.com`) to instantly filter tabs and bookmarks from specific sources.
- **Smart Highlighting**: Real-time highlighting of matched keywords keeps your visual focus clear.

### 🗂️ Unified Workspace
- **Vertical Tabs**: View full page titles, no longer compressed into tiny icons.
- **Native Group Support**: Perfectly integrates with Chrome Tab Groups, syncing colors and names.
- **Custom Window Naming**: Assign custom names to your windows (e.g., "Work", "Personal") for clearer context.
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive management—move items effortlessly between tabs, groups, and bookmark folders.
- **Drag to Save**: Drag a tab into the bookmarks area to save it instantly; drag a bookmark to the tabs area to open it.

### 🎨 Premium Design
- **Focus Mode**: A sleek dark theme with carefully tuned contrast to reduce eye strain.
- **Auto-Expand**: Hover over folders while dragging items to automatically expand the path.
- **Smart Hover**: Action buttons appear only when needed, keeping the interface clean and distraction-free.

### 📚 Reading List & RSS
Your personal article curation hub, right in the sidebar.
- **Chrome Reading List Integration**: Synced with Chrome's native Reading List for seamless "Save for Later" functionality.
- **RSS Subscription**: Subscribe to any RSS feed and have new articles automatically added to your reading list.
- **Smart Deduplication**: Hash-based filtering ensures no duplicate entries, even across multiple fetches.
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by date (newest/oldest) or title for quick access.
- **Manual Fetch**: Instantly pull the latest articles with a "Fetch Now" button.
- **Batch Clear**: Remove all read items with one click.


## ⌨️ Full Keyboard Navigation
- **Native Experience**: Use `Arrow Up`/`Arrow Down` keys to navigate seamlessly between tabs and bookmarks.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Use `Arrow Left`/`Arrow Right` to navigate and trigger internal buttons (like Close, Add to Group).
- **Search Integration**: Press `Up` at the top of the list to focus the search bar; press `Down` in the search bar to jump to results.
- **Focus Tip**: Once the sidebar is open, simply press any arrow key to automatically grab focus and start navigating.

## 🛠️ Build Commands

This project uses a `Makefile` to automate the build process.

*   **Development Mode**: `make` or `make package`

    This command creates an unminified development build. All source code remains as-is, making it easy to debug in Chrome's developer tools. The packaged file will be `arc-sidebar-v<version>-dev.zip`.

*   **Production Mode**: `make release`

    This command runs the production build process, which includes the following steps:
    1.  Bundles and minifies all JavaScript modules into a single file using `esbuild`.
    2.  Minifies the CSS file.
    3.  Packages the output into a `.zip` file suitable for uploading to the Chrome Web Store.

## 🧪 Testing

To ensure the quality and stability of the project's features, we adopt a use case testing approach to validate every change.

### Use Case Tests

*   **Purpose**: Each use case test clearly defines the expected behavior and operational flow of a specific feature. They are presented in descriptive text, detailing the test steps, preconditions, expected results, and verification methods.
*   **Location**: All use case test files are stored in the `usecase_tests/` folder at the project root.
*   **Execution & Verification**: These tests are currently primarily executed manually. Developers need to simulate user operations in the running Chrome extension according to the steps in the test files and observe whether the results meet expectations.

### Automated Testing

For future automated testing, we have chosen **Puppeteer** as our End-to-End (E2E) testing framework. This allows us to write scripts to simulate various user actions in the browser and verify functionality.
